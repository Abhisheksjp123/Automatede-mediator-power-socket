# Automatede-mediator-power-socket
Designed a product for automating household electrical appliances with power cord like TV, Blower, Greaser or
anything.
Devised an mediator to be put between the power socket and equipment power cord which can be controlled with a
mobile application. The microcontroller (Node-mcu) inside the mediator creates a Wi-Fi field, when connected to the
power socket. The application when connected to the Wi-Fi can do actions such as turning the device on/off or set
timer for turning device on/off. The project was made with the objective to make home automation portable and
feasible for regular household uses.
The project was displayed in Shrishti’19 “Annual technical festival of IIT Roorkee”.
